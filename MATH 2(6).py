#Some in built mathematical functions

x = 3.1412414
y = 4
z = 5
##round is a function to round off a float value to the nearest whole integer
##can also be used for specific rounding off like: format:round(num, upto how many digits)
result= round(x,4)
#result = round(x)

##abs is a function to find the distance of the float or int away from zero(absolute value)
#result=abs(y)

##pow function is used for power of variable
##format ==> (base, power or exponent)
#result = pow(y,3)

##using max function to find the maximum value of various values
#result = max(x,y,z)
##using min function to find the maximum value of various values
#result = min(x,y,z)


print(result)
